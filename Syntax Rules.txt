Welcome To ICE!

ICE is a lightweight, dynamic, interpreted language written in C# and runs for windows 
platform.

ICE is space sensitive

e.g 
20 * (10 + var) will not work, has to be
20 x (10 + var )

ICE Syntax:

Assign Variables:
	var [variable name] = [value]

Change Variable Values:
	chv [variable name] = [new value]

Math:
	+: Add
	-: Substract
	x: Multiply
	/: Divide
	(): Parantheses

	e.g
	(20 + 5) x var1 / 20 - 5 is a valid statement
